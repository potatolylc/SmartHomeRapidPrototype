# Smart Home Rapid Prototype

 This project provides a rapid prototyping software middleware framework which can be used for quickly building up an integrated smart home platform. The framework can communicate with a mobile device and a hardware platform via an open RESTful API, which can be regarded as a uniform interface and can greatly reduce the dependency on a specific product brand.

 The prototype provides a basic backend server framework for managing smart home users and smart home devices, and collecting and analysing sensor data and actuator data.
